"pytracemalloc" is no longer maintained here.

* For Python >= 3.4, the tracemalloc module has been proposed and accepted as the PEP 454 (https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0454) and the code has been merged into Python 3.4,
* For Python < 3.4, you can find the new repo here: **https://github.com/haypo/pytracemalloc**.

As a consequence, this repository is now frozen, and we are no longer accepting new issues or changes to it. Instead, please see https://github.com/haypo/pytracemalloc for the official implementation.

This repo and below information are kept here as an archive.

pytracemalloc
=============

Debug tool tracking Python memory allocations. Provide the following
information:

* Allocated size and number of allocations per file,
  or optionally per file and line number
* Compute the average size of memory allocations
* Compute delta between two "snapshots"
* Source of a memory allocation: filename and line number

Example (compact)::

    2013-02-28 23:40:18: Top 5 allocations per file
    #1: .../Lib/test/regrtest.py: 3998 KB

Python module developed by Wyplay: http://www.wyplay.com/

Project homepage: https://github.com/wyplay/pytracemalloc


Usage: Display top 25
=====================

Display the 25 files allocating the most memory every minute::

    import tracemalloc
    tracemalloc.enable()
    top = tracemalloc.DisplayTop(25)
    top.start(60)
    # ... run your application ...


By default, the top 25 is written into sys.stdout. You can write the output
into a file (here opened in append mode)::

    import tracemalloc
    tracemalloc.enable()
    log = open("tracemalloc.log", "a")
    top = tracemalloc.DisplayTop(25, file=log)
    top.start(60)
    # ... run your application ...
    log.close()


Usage: Take snapshots
=====================

For deeper analysis, it's possible to take a snapshot every minute::

    import tracemalloc
    tracemalloc.enable()
    take_snapshot = tracemalloc.TakeSnapshot()
    # take_snapshot.filename_template = "/tmp/trace-$pid-$timestamp.pickle"
    take_snapshot.start(60.0)
    # ... run your application ...

By default, files called "tracemalloc-XXXX.pickle" are created in the current
directory. Uncomment and edit the "filename_template" line in the example to
customize the filename. The filename template can use the following variables:
``$pid``, ``$timestamp``, ``$counter``.

To display and compare snapshots, use the following command::

    python -m tracemalloc trace1.pickle [trace2.pickle trace3.pickle ...]

Useful options:

* ``--line-number`` (``-l``): use also the line number to group
  Python memory allocations
* ``--first``: compare with the first trace, instead of with the previous
  trace
* ``--include=MATCH``: Only include filenames matching pattern MATCH,
  the option can be specified multiple times
* ``--exclude=MATCH``: Exclude filenames matching pattern MATCH,
  the option can be specified multiple times

Display the help to see more options to customize the display, type::

    python -m tracemalloc --help

It is also possible to take a snapshot explicitly::

   snapshot = tracemalloc.Snapshot.create()
   snapshot.write(filename)


PYTRACEMALLOC environment variable
==================================

Set ``PYTRACEMALLOC`` environment variable to 1 to trace memory allocations at
Python startup (call tracemalloc.enable()): "tracemalloc enabled" message
should be written to the standard error stream (stderr).

Example::

    $ PYTRACEMALLOC=1 python3.4 -q
    tracemalloc enabled
    >>> import tracemalloc
    >>> tracemalloc.DisplayTop(5).display()
    2013-06-01 18:51:48: Top 5 allocations per file
    #1: <frozen importlib._bootstrap>: size=1267 KiB, count=10277, average=126 B
    #2: .../Lib/collections/__init__.py: size=119 KiB, count=636, average=192 B
    #3: .../default/Lib/_weakrefset.py: size=98 KiB, count=751, average=133 B
    #4: .../default/Lib/abc.py: size=91 KiB, count=443, average=212 B
    #5: .../default/Lib/sysconfig.py: size=58 KiB, count=53, average=1134 B
    27 more: size=310 KiB, count=1469, average=216 B
    Total Python memory: size=1945 KiB, count=13629, average=146 B
    Total process memory: size=10 MiB (ignore tracemalloc: 23 KiB)


Installation
============

Patch Python
------------

To install pytracemalloc, you need a modified Python runtime:

* Download Python source code
* Apply a patch (see below):
  patch -p1 < pythonXXX.patch
* Compile and install Python:
  ./configure && make && sudo make install
* It can be installed in a custom directory. For example:
  ./configure --prefix=/opt/mypython

There are 3 types of Python patch to use pytracemalloc:

* Track free lists: track all Python objects. It is the recommended option.

  - Python 2.5.2: python2.5.2_track_free_list.patch
  - Python 2.7: python2.7_track_free_list.patch
  - Python 3.4: python3.4_track_free_list.patch

* Don't track free lists: less accurate, but faster.

  - Python 2.5.6: python2.5.6.patch
  - Python 2.7: python2.7.patch
  - Python 3.4: python3.4.patch

* Disable free lists: track all Python objects, slower.

  - Python 2.5: python2.5_no_free_list.patch
  - Python 2.7: python2.7_no_free_list.patch

Python uses "free lists" to avoid memory allocations for best performances.
When an object is destroyed, the memory is not freed, but kept in a list.
Creation of an object will try to reuse a dead object from the free list.
A free list is specific to an object type, or sometimes also to the length
of the object (for lists for example).

Python 3 uses free lists for the following object types:

* float
* tuple, list, set, dict
* bound method, C function, frame

Python 2 uses free lists for the following object types:

* int, float, unicode
* tuple, list, set, dict
* bound method, C function, frame


Compile and install pytracemalloc
---------------------------------

Dependencies:

* `Python <http://www.python.org>`_ 2.5 - 3.4
* `glib <http://www.gtk.org>`_ version 2
* (optional) `psutil <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/psutil>`_ to get the
  process memory. pytracemalloc is able to read the memory usage of the process
  on Linux without psutil.

Install::

    /opt/mypython/bin/python setup.py install


API
===

Call ``tracemalloc.enable()`` as early as possible to get the most complete
statistics. Otherwise, some Python memory allocations made by your application
will be ignored by tracemalloc. Set ``PYTRACEMALLOC`` environment variable to 1
to enable tracing at Python startup.

Call ``tracemalloc.disable()`` to stop tracing memory allocations. It is
automatically called at exit using the atexit module.

The version of the module is ``tracemalloc.__version__``
(string, ex: ``"0.9.1"``).


Functions
---------

- ``enable()``

  Start tracing Python memory allocations.

- ``disable()``

  Stop tracing Python memory allocations
  and stop the timer started by start_timer().

- ``get_process_memory()``

  Get the memory usage of the current process in bytes.
  Return None if the platform is not supported.

  Use the psutil module if available.

  New in pytracemalloc 0.8.

- ``start_timer(delay: int, func: callable, args: tuple=(), kwargs: dict={})``

  Start a timer calling ``func(*args, **kwargs)`` every *delay* seconds.

  The timer is based on the Python memory allocator, it is not real time.
  ``func`` is called after at least ``delay`` seconds, it is not called exactly
  after ``delay`` seconds if no Python memory allocation occurred.

  If ``start_timer()`` is called twice, previous parameters are replaced. The
  timer has a resolution of 1 second.

  ``start_timer()`` is used by ``DisplayTop`` and ``TakeSnapshot`` to run
  a task regularly.

- ``stop_timer()``

  Stop the timer started by ``start_timer()``.


Classes
-------

* DisplayGarbage(file=sys.stdout): Display new objects added to gc.garbage. By
  default, it displays uncollectible objects, see the documentation of
  gc.garbage. Use ``gc.set_debug(gc.DEBUG_SAVEALL)`` to display all deleted
  objects.
  Methods:

  - display(): display new objects added to gc.garbage since last call

  Attributes:

  - color (bool, default: stream.isatty()): if True, use colors
  - cumulative (bool, default: False): if True, display() displays all
    objects, if False, display() only displays new objects added to gc.garbage.
  - format_object (callable, default: repr.repr): function formatting an object


* DisplayTop(count: int, file=sys.stdout): Display the list of the N biggest
  memory allocations.
  Methods:

  - display(): display the top
  - start(delay: int): start a task using tracemalloc timer to display
    the top every delay seconds
  - stop(): stop the task started by the start() method

  Attributes:

  - color (bool, default: stream.isatty()): if True, use colors
  - compare_with_previous (bool, default: True): if True, compare with the
    previous top, otherwise compare with the first one
  - filename_parts (int, default: 3): Number of displayed filename parts
  - show_average (bool, default: True): if True, show the average size of
    allocations
  - show_count (bool, default: True): if True, show the number of allocations
  - show_lineno (bool, default: False): if True, use also the line number,
    not only the filename
  - show_size (bool, default: True): if True, show the size of allocations
  - user_data_callback (callable, default: None): optional callback collecting
    user data. See Snapshot.create().


* Snapshot: Snapshot of Python memory allocations. Use TakeSnapshot to
  regularly take snapshots.
  Methods:

  - create(user_data_callback=None): take a snapshot. If user_data_callback
    is specified, it must be a callable object returning a list of
    (title: str, format: str, value: int). format must be "size". The list
    must always have the same length and the same order to be able to compute
    differences between values.
    Example: [('Video memory', 'size', 234902)].
  - filter_filenames(patterns: str|list, include: bool): remove filenames not
    matching any pattern if include is True, or remove filenames matching a
    pattern if include is False (exclude). See fnmatch.fnmatch() for the
    syntax of patterns.
  - write(filename): write the snapshot into a file

  Attributes:

  - pid (int): identifier of the process which created the snapshot
  - stats (dict): raw memory allocation statistics
  - timestamp (str): date and time of the creation of the snapshot


* TakeSnapshot: Task taking snapshots of Python memory allocations: write them
  into files.
  Methods:

  - start(delay: int): start a task taking a snapshot every delay seconds
  - stop(): stop the task started by the start() method
  - take_snapshot(): take a snapshot

  Attribute:

  - filename_template (str): template to create a filename. "Variables" can
    be used in the template: "$pid" (identifier of the current process),
    "$timestamp" (current date and time) and "$counter" (counter starting at 1
    and incremented at each snapshot).
  - user_data_callback (callable, default: None): optional callback collecting
    user data. See Snapshot.create().
